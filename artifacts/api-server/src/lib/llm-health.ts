// ── Choosing a model by what it has actually done ─────────────────
// The fallback chain used to be ordered by hand: the account's provider, then
// whoever had a key, then a keyless last resort. That order encodes an opinion
// about which model is best, and the opinion was wrong — measured on
// 2026-09-25, Gemini returned 503 on every single attempt while Groq answered
// in under 1.5s every time, and four of OpenRouter's most popular free models
// were permanently rate-limited upstream.
//
// So the order is derived from outcomes instead. Two things matter and they
// pull in different directions: a model that answers is worth more than a fast
// one, and a model that has just failed four times in a row is worth skipping
// entirely rather than waiting on its timeout every call.

// next rung on its very next call anyway. Capped at an hour so nothing is ever
// written off permanently — the upstream that is rate-limited this afternoon is
// the one this account depends on tonight.
